The value sources of virtual currency mainly include the following aspects:


Supply and demand relationship: The value of virtual currency is affected by its supply and demand relationship, that is, when the supply is less and the demand is greater, its value may rise, and conversely, its value may fall.


Technical support: The value of virtual currency is also affected by its technical support, such as blockchain technology, security, convenience, etc.


Market belief: The value of virtual currency is also affected by market belief, that is, market participants' confidence and expectations in virtual currency have an impact on its value.
The main ways to preserve the value of virtual currency are as follows:


Cold wallet: Store virtual currency in a cold wallet to reduce the risk of being hacked.


Multi-signature: Using multi-signature technology, multiple private keys are required to agree to conduct transactions to increase transaction security.


Decentralized storage: Store virtual currency in multiple places to reduce the risk of single points of failure.


Regular backup: Regularly back up the private keys and wallet files of virtual currencies to prevent losses caused by data loss.
